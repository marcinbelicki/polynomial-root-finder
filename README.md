### Polynomial Root Finder

Polynomial Root Finder is a scala library, which provides classes of trait Polynomial for linear, quadratic, cubic and
quatric polynomials. However, the key functionality of finding roots of polynomial is implemented for PolynomialRootFinder
trait's instances. The solutions are purely analytical, but the model enables adding other solutions (i.e. numeric).
